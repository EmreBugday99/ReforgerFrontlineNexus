# Frontline Nexus

### Abstract Idea
The Game Mode heavily encourages combat and makes combat easily accessible to the players. The game mode provides never-ending action and ensures that any player desiring to enter battle can easily do so. The game mode should also encourage player progression, resulting in more efficiency and power in combat, making it more likely for players to spend more time within the game mode to become more powerful and get rewarded for their time spent within.

### Desired Goal
Game Mode should continuously spoonfeed dopamine to the player. While doing this, it should reward fighting, serving as a classic carrot and stick motivation. When awarded, it will create a feedback loop where the player constantly craves the next reward to participate in the combat more efficiently and powerfully.

### Core Concepts
- Small Game Area
  - A small game area ensures the time spent between traveling to the combat is nonexistent or very small.
- Progression
  - Players should be rewarded with something for staying within the desired gameplay loop.
  - This reward should enable players to obtain better equipment and vehicles, enhancing their combat experience.
  - This could be anything from leveling/experience to money. What it is in definition is irrelevant and is merely cosmetic as long as it solves the desired goals.
- Goals
  - Goals provide a way to pull a lot of players into one location, ensuring that the area will have plenty of action and adrenaline.
  - Goals can be anything from Capture Points to Missions. They aim to pull many players into one place to ensure combat and reward the people for completing them.
